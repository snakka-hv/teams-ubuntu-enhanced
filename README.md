## No Longer In Development
I am no longer working on the project. There is official microsoft supported application for linux OS and hence, would recommend users to depend on that.
If anyone would like to experiment with electron and teams, please feel free to continue modifying the source code on your own.

### Usage:
* You can download the artifacts from release page
    * Debian and direct electron packages are available for use
* Post installation, launch the application and login with your teams credentials
* Once authenticated, the credentials will be reused on subsequent launches

### Modifying, Building the code yourself
* Project is like any other npm code base.
* ``npm install`` & ``npm start`` would start the application in development mode
* ``npm run dist & npm run deb`` will generate the electron packages along with a deb file

### Enhanced features
* Provides native OS notifications
* Highlights unread message from users with a background color for easier readability
* Supports video-calling

### Features to work upon
* Support screensharing
* Support optional notification audio note
* Unread notifications replay


### Project reference:
* All thanks to: [Leftstick](https://github.com/leftstick/teams-ubuntu) for the scratch code-base
* A fork-PR will be made in near future to the parent project on which these enhancements were made.
